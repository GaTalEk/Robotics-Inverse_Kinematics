# EECE 487 Robotics: Inverse Kinematics

Part 2 of 3

The project involved the modeling of a 6-degree-of-freedom SCARA robot in Matlab Simulink. All sections controlled the model arm using a Novint Falcon controller.

Part 2 used inverse kinematics to map the controller position to the end-effector position, and used Matlab to calculate and display the joint angles and arm position.

The collection of files is not functional, as it is missing the config files specific to the lab setup.
